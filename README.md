# License Plate Detection and Perspective Correction with openCV

This project focuses on detecting the license plate from an image, finding its contours, and applying perspective correction to obtain a properly aligned and cropped image of the plate.

## Overview

This application processes a given image to:
1. **Detect the largest contour** that likely represents a license plate.
2. **Draw the contour** on the original image for visualization.
3. **Apply perspective correction** to extract the plate in a straightened format.

The output consists of three images:
- The original image.
- The image with the detected contour.
- The warped image after perspective correction.

## Images

### Example Output

Here are some example outputs generated by the program:

#### Original Image, Contour Image, and Warped Image for Plate 1

## Code Explanation

The code for this project is written in Python using OpenCV and Matplotlib libraries.

### Key Functions:
- **`preprocess_image(img)`**: Converts the input image to grayscale, applies blurring, increases contrast, and thresholds the image to prepare it for contour detection.
- **`find_largest_contour(edges)`**: Finds and returns the largest contour in the preprocessed image.
- **`correct_perspective(image, contour)`**: Applies perspective transformation to straighten the license plate based on the detected contour.

### How It Works:
1. **Image Preprocessing**: The input image is first converted to grayscale, blurred, and thresholded to highlight the edges of the license plate.
2. **Contour Detection**: The code identifies the largest contour in the preprocessed image, which corresponds to the license plate.
3. **Perspective Correction**: The detected contour is used to apply a perspective transformation, aligning the plate horizontally in the final output.

### Running the Code:
To run the program, use the following command in your terminal or IDE:
```python
python main.py
